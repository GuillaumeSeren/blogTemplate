blogTemplate
============

Joomla! template of my blog.

## Idea
Make a nice and responsive template with the minimum images,
try to use svg and css only.

## Platform
This template is made for Joomla! v3.0 at least,
but you should easily convert it for other platform.

To package the code as Joomla! Extension just run:

    tar cvvzf ../blogTemplate.tar.gz *
